Developed a console application to provide real-time fishing forecasts for locations
across Bulgaria. The application integrates live weather data from national forecast
website, considering predefined parameters such as wind speed, precipitation, and
river water levels to compute the optimal fishing spot. The application will be
developed to use API for retrieving the data and plan to build a website to enhance
the user interface

Тhe main data source is http://www.weather.bg/ - National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology in Bulgaria.
